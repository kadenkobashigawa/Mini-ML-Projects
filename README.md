# Mini-ML-Projects
Here are some fun and creative projects to explore state of the art ML architectures and applications.


# 1. Blackjack
Play by yourself, with friends, or against AI. This program includes a terminal blackjack game with a built-in betting mechanism & a trainable blackjack AI. Players (human or AI) can hit, stand, double, or split while the AI learns optimal strategies using a PyTorch neural network.

## Features
- Full Blackjack gameplay with betting and multiple players.
- AI player that learns from outcomes and uses card counting for strategy.
- Tracks game statistics and plots player balances over rounds.
- Designed as a hands-on playground for ML experimentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

## Usage
- Enter number of players and names (prefix AI names with "AI", e.g., AI_1).
- Place bets and choose actions (h for hit, s for stand, double, and split).
- Watch the AI learn and adapt over time.
